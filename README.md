# Attempt to Extend Interface of Clickable Hex Map
A bank of vertical buttons was added to the left of Clickable Hex Map, within the same window.
Although the hexagonal polygons remain visible,
their clickability/identifiability has unfortunately been lost.
Note that the zoom/drag functionality of the Camera2D is retained.
