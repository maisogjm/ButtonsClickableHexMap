# ClickableHexMap with Extended Interface
A demo of an array of clickable hexagons overlaid on top of a hex map, along with zooming/panning ability, implemented using the Godot Engine v3.2.3.stable.official.
A bank of vertical buttons has been added to the left of Clickable Hex Map, within the same window.

Here are instructions for interacting with the map:
1. Left-mouse click in the map to see the Hexagon Number in the Console.
2. Right-mouse click and drag in the map to pan the view.
3. Roll the mouse wheel up and down to zoom in and zoom out. Alternatively, you can use the "+" and "-" keys on the numeric keypad.
4. Press the Space bar on your keyboard to return the map to the original view.
